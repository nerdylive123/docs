# Workers overview

Workers are the foundation of RunPod's serverless platform, executing code in response to API requests and automatically scaling based on demand. This guide provides a technical reference for implementing and working with RunPod workers.

## Core components

A RunPod worker consists of these essential components:

### Handler function

The handler function is the entry point for all requests:

```python
def handler(event):
    """Process incoming requests"""
    # Extract input data
    job_input = event["input"]
    
    # Process the input
    result = process_data(job_input)
    
    # Return response
    return result
```

### Container environment

Workers run in Docker containers with:
- Pre-configured runtime environment
- GPU acceleration (when needed)
- Network access for external API calls
- Isolated execution environment

### Configuration options

Workers can be configured with:
- Container image
- Hardware resources (CPU, RAM, GPU)
- Environment variables
- Network settings
- Scaling parameters

## Worker lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: When a worker starts, it loads dependencies and models
2. **Request handling**: The worker processes incoming jobs from the queue
3. **Response delivery**: Results are returned to the client
4. **Scaling**: Workers are created or destroyed based on queue depth
5. **Termination**: Workers shut down after the idle timeout

## Implementation patterns

### Synchronous processing

The default pattern processes each request and returns results immediately:

```python
def handler(event):
    # Process input and return result directly
    return process_data(event["input"])
```

### Asynchronous processing

For long-running tasks, process jobs asynchronously:

```python
def handler(event):
    # Start processing in background
    process_id = start_background_task(event["input"])
    
    # Return job ID for status tracking
    return {"process_id": process_id, "status": "processing"}
```

### Batch processing

Process multiple items in a single request:

```python
def handler(event):
    # Process a batch of items
    items = event["input"]["items"]
    results = [process_item(item) for item in items]
    
    return {"results": results}
```

## Development guidelines

For optimal worker performance:

1. **Minimize initialization time**: Load models and dependencies at startup
2. **Optimize memory usage**: Release resources when not needed
3. **Handle errors gracefully**: Return clear error information
4. **Validate input data**: Check required parameters
5. **Implement proper logging**: Use structured logging for troubleshooting
