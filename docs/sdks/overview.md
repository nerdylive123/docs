This guide helps you use RunPod SDKs to build and manage AI applications. Choose your preferred programming language and follow the guides that match your goals.

## Quick start

Get started quickly with your preferred programming language:

- [Python SDK](python/overview.md) - Best for AI/ML applications
- [JavaScript SDK](javascript/overview.md) - Ideal for web applications
- [Go SDK](go/overview.md) - Great for high-performance services
- [GraphQL API](graphql/configurations.md) - Direct API access

## Common use cases

### Build AI applications
- [Create serverless endpoints](python/endpoints.md)
- [Deploy ML models](python/apis.md)
- [Monitor application performance](python/structured-logging.md)

### Manage infrastructure
- [Set up GPU instances](python/apis.md#list-available-gpus)
- [Configure templates](python/apis.md#create-templates)
- [Scale resources](python/apis.md#create-endpoints)

### Monitor and debug
- [Track application logs](python/structured-logging.md)
- [Monitor performance](python/apis.md)
- [Debug issues](python/structured-logging.md#log-levels)

## Choose your SDK

Each SDK is optimized for different use cases:

### Python SDK
Best for:
- AI/ML model deployment
- Data processing pipelines
- Scientific computing
- Quick prototyping

### JavaScript SDK
Best for:
- Web applications
- Frontend integrations
- Browser-based tools
- Node.js services

### Go SDK
Best for:
- High-performance services
- Microservices
- CLI tools
- System utilities

### GraphQL API
Best for:
- Custom integrations
- Direct API access
- Complex queries
- Real-time updates

## Next steps

1. Choose your preferred programming language
2. Follow the quick start guide
3. Explore use case examples
4. Build your application

> **Note:** All SDKs provide similar core functionality. Choose based on your team's expertise and project requirements.
