You can connect to a Pod through various methods, depending on your requirements, preferences, and templates used.

## SSH terminal

Connecting to a Pod using an SSH terminal is a secure and reliable method, suitable for long-running processes and critical tasks.

Every Pod contains the ability to connect through SSH.

To do this, you need to have an SSH client installed on your local machine.

1. Open the terminal on your local machine.
2. Choose one of the following commands and then enter it into your machine's terminal:

```sh
# No support for SCP & SFTP
ssh <username>@<pod-ssh-hostname> -i <path-to-ssh-key>

# Supports SCP & SFTP
ssh <username>@<pod-ip-address> -p <ssh-port> -i <path-to-ssh-key>
```

Replace the placeholders with the following:

* `<username>`: Your assigned username for the Pod
* `<pod-ssh-hostname>`: The SSH hostname provided for your Pod
* `<pod-ip-address>`: The IP address of your Pod
* `<ssh-port>`: The designated SSH port for your Pod
* `<path-to-ssh-key>`: The path to your SSH private key file

You now have a secure SSH terminal to your Pod.

## Web terminal
